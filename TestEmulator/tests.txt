test 1:
for the sub operation, i will test whether the added 1 to the inverted register
is considered when setting the carry flags. to test this, i will set the A register
to FF, and the B register to 00. i will call the sub on B, and B will be converted
to FF, and then increment by one, going to 00. FF plus 00 produces no carries. however,
FF plus one does. so if the flags come true, then we know the one is considered.
result: the carry flag was false, but it's inversed in sub so it's true. the one is included
in the carry.
further testing with B - 240 and A - 0 reveals that the aux_carry considers the one. interesting....
so, the one is definitely in consideration. now, the testing will reveal the nature of aux_carry.
alright, the aux_carry works as you'd expect.
